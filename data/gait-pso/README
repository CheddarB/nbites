swarms/ <-- full swarm pickle files in varying states of completion

::ON WEBOTS::

You will need Webots Pro version to do gait optimization. For
information on how to get a temporary pro license or generally set up
Webots (version >= 6.2.4), look at our the webots page on trac.

copy the following two files (do ./sync down in this directory to get
them) into your webots directory:

NaoV3S.proto -> {WEBOTS}/resources/protos/robots/nao/
nao1-optimize.wbt -> {WEBOTS}/projects/contests/robotstadium/worlds/

Then load the nao1-optimize.wbt world file from within Webots.

::ON THE NAO::

TODO!!

::GENERAL INFO::

The gait optimizer behavior (pGaitLearner.py) loads our Particle Swarm
Optimizer (found in noggin/util/PSO.py) and will automatically save
the swarm state and revert Webots after each gait trial. The current
PSO state is pickled as PSO_pGaitLearner.pickle, and generally shows
up in {WEBOTS}/projects/contests/robotstadium/controllers/nao_team_1/.
