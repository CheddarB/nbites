{"tagline":"The Northern Bites RoboCup Soccer Package","google":"UA-33906793-1","body":"Northern Bites\r\n==============\r\n\r\nNorthern Bites is Bowdoin Collegeâ€™s robot team.\r\n\r\nWe compete in the Standard Platform League of RoboCup (formerly the Four Legged League) where teams consisting of four Aldebaran Nao robots each play on a field of 6 m x 4 m. The robots operate fully autonomously; there is no external control by humans or computers.\r\n\r\nWe are the former World Champions on the Sony Aibo platform, and in 2008 placed third in the last Aibo competition and in the quarterfinal round in our first Nao competition. In 2009 we took second, followed by another quarterfinal appearance in 2010, and consecutive round of 16 years in 2011 and 2012. The team is coming off our strongest performance in years, despite not advancing as far as we would have liked. We are looking to bring the fire for the 2013 competitions.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nFor information on our code, please visit our [github repo](https://github.com/northern-bites/nbites).\r\nFor information on the team, please visit our [website](http://robocup.bowdoin.edu/).","note":"Don't delete this file!
