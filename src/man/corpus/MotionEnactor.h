/**
 * This class is an abstraction to send commands from our robot code to the
 * underlying robot code, depending on the platform. The idea is to try
 * to remove as much platfrom dependant code from our code base and conncentrate
 * it in files which are 'hot swappable' so if we change from simmulation to
 * the robot, we can easily do this by creating a new Enactor/Transcriber pair.
 *
 * Note that this file was originally created only to send joint information
 * from the switchboard to ALMotion/Webots, so this transformation is not
 * complete yet. Also, there is still no enactor for Webots.
 *
 * See also Transcriber, ThreadedEnactor, NaoEnactor (DCM)
 * and ALEnactor(ALMotion).
 *
 * Future improvements. The interface could be more generalize by making
 * the switchboard private, and require lower classes to call methods in this
 * class to access information from the switchboard. At this point,
 * there is no need for that extra effort however. Also this class should be
 * named "Enactor" not MotionEnactor
