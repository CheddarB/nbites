     Data is given to the log_process thread via the NBlog function.
     
     Each call COPIES all relevant data, using mutexes to modify the log data ring buffers.
     
     Since the logging system keeps its own copies of all data, memory usage is an issue.  The log_process
     keeps a limited number of each type of log data, low
     density and high density.  Low-density refers to large objects such as images.  High density refers to
     messages with high information density, such as proto-buffs.
     
     generally, the larger a log object the higher index buffer it should be placed in.  Right now,
     
     index 0 = high density
     index 1 = low density
     
     The log_process immediately overwrites old objects as the buffer fills up.  If no io system is currently using the object (references == 0), it is immediately free'd.  If an io system is using the object, log_process removes it from the ring buffer.  It is now up to the last io system to stop using the object to free it.
     */
    
    /*
     NEEDS WORK:
     
     Should have all threads use attributes on creation, to make it easier to change priorities.  We might want higher priorities (trying to get as much data logged as possible) or very low priorities (not interfereing with host system).
     
     Better system for sending object attributes?
