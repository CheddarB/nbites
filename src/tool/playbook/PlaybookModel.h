    // 4) Ball Y-Position       FIELD_HEIGHT/ BOX_SIZE + 2
    // Note: #2 (above) is a priority ordered list of roles for a
    // varying number of active field players. For example, the first
    // three entries would be for when we have 4 active field players;
    // the chaser is not in the list, the first position is the
    // defender, next is the offender, and last is the middie; the
    // next two entries are for when there are 3 active field players
    // (defender and offender); and the last position is just the two
    // active field player case. So the 2nd dimension of the array is:
    //
    // 4-Defender | 4-Offender | 4-Middie | 3-Defender | 3-Offender | 2-Defender
    //
    // Where the number is the active field players present. The 3rd
    // and 4th dimensions of the playbook, then, handle where that role should
    // go given where the ball is.
